Role Name
=========

This role installs the binary for zneix/haste-client v1.1.
It also provides a YAML file to download and compile the repository, but it's not recommended since it needs golang installed, making the installation process much heavier.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - haste-server
